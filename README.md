Installation
-------------
Put the "ShaderForge" folder in the project you want to use Shader Forge in.
If you have an old version of Shader Forge installed, remove the *entire* ShaderForge folder before installing the new one


If you finish and release a product using Shader Forge, I would appreciate a mention of Shader Forge in the credits :)


Quick start
------------
Opening Shader Forge = Window -> Shader Forge
Panning = Click and drag empty space
Zooming = Mouse wheel
Adding nodes = RMB + select node OR drag from right panel and place OR hold the first letter of the node name, and scroll to the node you want, then click
Moving nodes = Click and drag
Selecting nodes = Click to select, shift/control click to add to selection
Box select nodes = Hold Alt + Drag. Shift/control click to add to selection
Deleting nodes = Select and press delete

Selling shaders created in Shader Forge
----------------------------------------
Shaders created in SF can be used freely in commercial and non-commercial projects with no restrictions.
If you are creating assets for the asset store using SF shaders, people will probably want to know if the shaders are created with Shader Forge,
so they know they can easily be modified!
I would also be super happy if you were to credit SF in the asset store description,blinked to the website http://www.acegikmo.com/shaderforge/
